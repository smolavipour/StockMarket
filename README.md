# Learn Trading in Stock Market 
In this series of work I try to develope tools to have a better understanding of the US market and get some signals for trading.


In the main directory, I am putting small pieces of codes to test various packages like yFinance, Yahoo financials, rtc. In the Market Search directory, I have developed tools to search over all tickers and filter the ones with good performance (in terms of volume, and price). Next I try to predict the price using decision tree and other machine learning tools.
